# currency converter project

## (getting accureate currency conversion rate)

```
for accurate conversion-rate get rate online so calling an api.

need a hook/function that will that get the conversion info and store it for use.

this hook need to call on page load and whenever chaning the currency type and amount so it will take an arrgument.

mostly api calls value come in string-type but looks like json format.

so api call need to be converted into json.
```

## main code

```
now main code time.

nedd for type of value
1. amount
2. amount currency type
3. in which currency it needs to convert
4. amount after conversion

then for conversion take the amount and its curreny type and multiple it to desired currency type. that give converted amount.

for swap we have three option
1. just swap the currency and leave the amount as it is.
2. swap both currency and amount.
3.swap only amount.

for this project we are going with numbe two swapping both currency and amount.
```

## extra feature

```
we can disable currency input for converted currency.
